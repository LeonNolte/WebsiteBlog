                The first things I spotted when I first looked at it were the multitude of monkeys, some of them running around in old-timey clothing. 
                Then of course, there is the beautiful scenery with houses, nature and what seems to be a castle in the background. 
                Upon closer inspection, you might spot that the many flowers that the monkeys interact with, 
                and that there is money involved in whatever is taking place in this painting…
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                When I first had a look at this painting in my introductory art history course, I was rather confused. 
                The entire painting seemed like an absurdist art piece that would fit much more into the modern era than the 17th century Netherlands. 
                But as I soon found out, the nature of this oil painting was not absurdist, but satirical.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                It is a little-known fact that speculative bubbles like the ones one might associate with institutions like Wall Street have existed for almost 40 years. 
                In fact, the painting we have been looking at is about the first occurrence of such a speculative bubble in history, the so-called “Tulipomania.” 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Strangely, this 380-year-old painting has regained a sense of relevance recently, at least for me. 
                When I heard that people were buying digital copies of monkey-portraits for millions of dollars, I had to think about this painting, not only because it involves a lot of monkeys, 
                but also because it satirizes the kind of behavior, I see in the people spending a fortune speculating on monkey portraits.
